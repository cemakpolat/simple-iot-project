## Project Status

The puprose of this Container was to provide a configurable and decent mosquitto broker container. The Eclipse Mosquitto Project now provides
a very similar Container - See [Other Containers](#other-containers) below.
This container still uses Debian/Jessie as a base container which is kinda old.

Feel free to send Pull Requests. As I don't use this container any longer it's 
kinda tricky to test and keep compatibility at a level I would like.

## Run
docker run -ti -p 127.0.0.1:1883:1883 -p 9001:9001  toke/mosquitto
    docker run -ti -p 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 toke/mosquitto

Exposes Port 1883 (MQTT) 9001 (Websocket MQTT)

## Running with persistence


### Local directories / External Configuration

Alternatively you can use volumes to make the changes
persistent and change the configuration.

    mkdir -p /srv/mqtt/config/
    mkdir -p /srv/mqtt/data/
    mkdir -p /srv/mqtt/log/
    # place your mosquitto.conf in /srv/mqtt/config/
    # NOTE: You have to change the permissions of the directories
    # to allow the user to read/write to data and log and read from
    # config directory
    # For TESTING purposes you can use chmod -R 777 /srv/mqtt/*
    # Better use "-u" with a valid user id on your docker host

    # Copy the files from the config directory of this project
    # into /src/mqtt/config. Change them as needed for your
    # particular needs.

    docker run -ti -p 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 \
    -v /srv/mqtt/config:/mqtt/config:ro \
    -v /srv/mqtt/log:/mqtt/log \
    -v /srv/mqtt/data/:/mqtt/data/ \
    --name mqtt toke/mosquitto

Volumes: /mqtt/config, /mqtt/data and /mqtt/log

### Docker Volumes for persistence

Using [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/) for persistence.

Create a named volume:

    docker volume create --name mosquitto_data

Now it can be attached to docker by using `-v mosquitto_data:/mqtt/data` in the
Example above. Be aware that the permissions within the volumes
are most likely too restrictive.

## Start with systemd

As an example this how you run the container with systemd.
The example uses a docker volume named `mosquitto_data` (see above).

    [Unit]

    Wants=docker.service
    After=docker.service

    [Service]

    ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop -t 2 mqtt
    ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/docker rm -f mqtt

    [Install]

## Build

    git clone https://github.com/toke/docker-mosquitto.git
    cd docker-mosquitto
    docker build .

## Other Containers

The puprose of this Container was to provide a configurable and dsecent mosquitto broker.
The Eclipse Mosquitto Project now provides a very similar Container:
[Eclipse Mosquitto Container](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto/) It should be
easy to migrate to it.
