# Building a Simple IoT middleware

## Use Case 

A smart factory environment is composed of many simple and complex devices that owns diverse features. The harmonization of all these features necessitates an IoT platform that unifies distinguished data models ranging from devices to human actor. The well known topic and crucial aspect of the smart factories is to predict beforehand when a device will be broken, since the whole production chain can severely be affected from a broken device in the system, and this may lead to stopping the complete system, which is not desired due to the cost and user perspectives. In order to prevent this kind of issues, a predictive maintenance system should be introduced to foresee when a device will be damaged, and it has to be replaced. To visualize such a use-case, we assume that a temperature sensor embedded in the production line is continuously monitored in a factory environment. All data retrieved from this sensor to the backend services for further analysis. Based on the observation analysis, the possibility of having a broken device is predicted. In the following section, only the data aggregation and visualization parts are implemented. The predictive maintenance module will be later integrated in the rest of the system.


## System Architecture 

The realization of this idea can be performed via a small IoT setup presented below.

### Required Technologies

- Communication Protocols: MQTT, HTTP, Websocket 
- Programming Language: C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
- Database: MongoDB
- Container Tech: Docker
- Machine Learning Algorithm: LSTM, â€¦ (TODO)

### System Components 

0. MQTT Broker

The data distribution among all other components are carried out via MQTT broker.

1. Temperature Sensor/Service (Producer):

Sensor simulates a temperature service that generates randomly temperature values and sends it through MQTT communication protocol to the broker as a publisher. The device simulating service first transmits data and then stops for a while in a continous loop. 

2. Data Processing&Observer Service (Temperature Observer Service / Data Consumer)

This module consumes the data sent from the temperature sensor and process it. The actual service sends all received objects to the MQTT broker as well as error messages if any message is received for a while.

3. Data Storing&Requesting Service 

All sensor data is directly stored in the mongo database and the swagger interface enables to fetch the stored data from the database.

4. User Interfaces

An enduser application is offered to monitor the temperature sensor values and the log messages sent by the services. These interfaces are demonstrated below:

5. Predictive Maintenance (TODO)

An autonomous smart factory necessitates to detect the errorness or the possibility of having a failure at devices. The predictive maintenance service aims at aggregating the data from the sensors and predict whether the device behaves normal based on the historical data. This component will be added as a future work.
